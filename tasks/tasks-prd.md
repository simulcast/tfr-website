### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Brand & Design System Reference

- **Color Palette:** Use the following CSS variables and hex codes from `tfr-identity-guidelines.md`:
  - Primary Green: `#004116` (`--color-primary-green`)
  - Background Green: `#eff6f2` (`--color-background-green`)
  - Card Gray: `#d9d9d9` (`--color-card-gray`)
  - Card Shadow Green: `#397e58` (`--color-card-shadow-green`)
  - Metadata Gray: `#ebebeb` (`--color-metadata-gray`)
- **Typography:**
  - Headings: `Space Grotesk, Bold, sans-serif` (e.g., 64px for main, 32px for section)
  - Body: `Inter, Regular, sans-serif` (24px main, 16px metadata)
  - Metadata/Highlights: `Inter, Bold, sans-serif`
- **Mobile Responsiveness:**
  - All components and layouts must be mobile-first and fully responsive, matching Figma wireframes for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
  - Use Tailwind CSS breakpoints: mobile (<768px), tablet (768px-1024px), desktop (>1024px).
  - Ensure touch/swipe support and accessible tap targets on mobile.
