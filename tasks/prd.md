- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace, clean and uncluttered
- **Animations**: Subtle and purposeful, not distracting
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support

## Technical Considerations

1. **Stack Suggestions**

   - Framer Motion for shuffle animations
   - Static generation where possible for performance

## Open Questions

1. How many total projects should be included in v1?
2. Should there be any subtle indication that the portfolio scrolls horizontally on desktop?
3. What should happen if a project has both image and video assets?
4. Should the shuffle animation style be a fade, slide, or something else?
5. Do we need a fallback for users with JavaScript disabled?
6. Should we implement basic error states (e.g., if image fails to load)?
7. What's the exact green color hex code from the mockup?

## Next Steps

1. Finalize project content (gather all images, write descriptions)
2. Set up repository and development environment
3. Implement core layout and responsive design
4. Add shuffle functionality
5. Test across devices and browsers
6. Deploy to production
